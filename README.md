# RxTemplateForUnity

This project was an attempt to create a programming template for games within the Unity Engine. The template implements reactive (Rx) mechanisms to deal with assets as immutably as possible through Unity's Asset Manager. Specific behaviours would be enacted using the [vague] concept of "chains of causes".

The project was abandoned due to performance concerns.
